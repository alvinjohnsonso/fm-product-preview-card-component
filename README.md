## My process

This is made by following the video of [Kevil Powell's frontend mentor challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjPregcc6pgAIerVqSWaJEM4). It's a copy of his solution but I went through it step by step.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [CSS Reset by Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)

### What I learned

First and foremost, I learned how Kevin Powell tackles a project from scratch. How he laid out everything on the HTML. All the content, alternate content, and classes the project would possibly contain. Then proceeding on styling the component.

Next is how he defined some of the HTML5 elements. He mentioned that an `article` can be a standalone piece of content where that piece of code can be taken out and moved to another webpage easily. Then the usage of `picture` and `source` elements, it's quite convenient now to be able to switch images from HTML only.

I also learned a couple of CSS Grid stuff since I really haven't touched CSS Grid and I will probably look through and use it on the next challenge that I'll do.

### Continued development

Here's a list of things I'll want to focus on.
- CSS Grid
- Working and structuring with Sass

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset by Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - I highly recommend reading the explanation of each of the CSS he wrote on his CSS Reset snippet. I learned a lot of CSS concepts while reading through it.
